gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json --iam-account ${FMLTC_GCLOUD_PROJECT_ID}-service-account@${FMLTC_GCLOUD_PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```
7. Enable APIs.
   - [ ] Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)"  \
    https://ml.googleapis.com/v1/projects/${FMLTC_GCLOUD_PROJECT_ID}:getConfig
```
   - [ ] Look for the tpuServiceAccount value in the curl command output.
   - [ ] Set the environment variable FMLTC_TPU_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
```
FMLTC_TPU_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=<tpu service account>
export FMLTC_TPU_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
```
   - [ ] Run the following command
```
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${FMLTC_GCLOUD_PROJECT_ID}  \

```


## Create and upload the team_info/teams file.
1. Create a text file named `teams` containing one line for each team allowed to use the tools.
   Each line should look like this:
```
<program>,<team number>,<team code>
```
   - Program must be FTC or FRC.
   - Team number should be the team number.
   - Team code should be the code that is given to that team. It can contain any characters and can be any length.
   Here's an example
```
FTC, 25,    094e801d
FTC, 724,   3ac64ab3
FTC, 3595,  051699ac
FTC, 11115, 6629ab97
FRC, 67,    8bfef8bf
FRC, 254,   f929a006
FRC, 1678,  f67145cf
```
2. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/my_project_id-blobs?project=my_project_id (replace my_project_id with your actual project ID)
3. Click `Create folder`. Enter `team_info` and click `CREATE`.
4. Click `team_info` to go to https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/my_project_id-blobs/team_info/?project=my_project_id (replace my_project_id with your actual project ID)
